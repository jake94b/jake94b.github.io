All about me!

### More Information

I've never known how to start this things, so I'll go with the basics. My interests are quite wide and diverse, ranging from Linux Security all the way to Warhammer. 

I got into computer science because I always found myself drawn to computers, but never really connected the wires together until college. I was not enjoying the path I was going down, and wanted to do some soul searching before I found myself without any direction to go. The answer I kept coming back to seemed to be computers, as I had always been fascinated with them at a young age, dating back to when I played around with the settings on iMacs at my schools library (I of course ended up getting in trouble when one had stopped working, but beside the point). 

Fast forward several years and I have not regretted my decision. So many paths have opened to my ever since I decided to pursue a future in programming, and I want to further my knowledge by updating this blog with my thoughts on recent events in fields I'm interested in, updates on projects I'm working on, as well as just personal events or other things that catch my eye. Feel free to stay updated!
