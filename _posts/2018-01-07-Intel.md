title: On the Intel CPU Vulnerabilties
---


**Spectre**
A class of exploits that attack any modern processor's branching execution pipeline. Modern CPUs can execute multiple "paths" of instructions simultaneously, when the right path depends on the result of a calculation that haven't yet completed. The CPU then discards the results it doesn't need and keeps the ones it does. This general idea is present in every modern processor design, and without it even our highest clocked CPUs would have the performance of some 90s-era piece of shit. But, the machinery that makes it possible is very intricate, and these attacks are meant to twist the way the CPU operates under the hood in ways the designers didn't expect. To completely eliminate this class of attacks will require a redesign of every architecture, to figure out how to prevent side-channel information disclosure from speculative branches. This will likely take years. There is no other workaround. It's possible that these techniques will be used to craft exploits in the wild, but the level of difficulty is probably very high.
**Meltdown**
A specific attack that allows non-readable addresses to be read. It works by speculatively reading the memory and then quickly side-channeling it out before an exception occurs. This is easy to exploit (HUGE information leaks, reading disk encryption keys, keyboard input, etc), trivial to reproduce under most conditions, and definitely affects Intel processors. It potentially could affect AMD, but AMD claims that their microarchitecture doesn't allow even speculative reads that violate page protections in this manner. If this is true, it completely kills the vulnerability with no workaround required. The current workaround (KPTI/KAISER) works by unmapping kernel memory from the user address space. This is expensive, and workloads that need to call into the kernel frequently will suffer a lot.
