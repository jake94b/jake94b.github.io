title: My Resolutions for the New Year
---


As the year of 2017 comes to a wrap, it leaves me reflecting on everything I have built up to. At the start of the year, I was hardly comfortable with Javascript, and still using Windows 10 on my laptop. I was nervous of the prospects of the future, to the point where I was shedding hair like crazy. Today, I have started to make several web applications, not only introducing myself to several Javascript frameworks, but I have also begun to learn to integrate Google APIs. I have also migrated my laptop to the latest version of Debian linux(9, as of writing this), and I absolutely love it. A lot has changed over the course of this year, and I forsee even more changes coming up. I will be graduating school in less than two weeks, taking my first steps into the real world. So where does this leave me? It leaves me with the need to prepare for what is to come.

With the year 2018 approaching, I want to make several resolutions for myself, to not only better myself mentally, but to physically. At the end of each month, I will provide an update post as to where I am in terms of making progress on this resolutions. 

## Programming Resolutions ##

**Make at least one commit to a Github repository each day**

I have only just started to regularly use my github account to store my side projects, as well as other things. My first resolution is to make at least one github commit to one of my projects each day in the year 2018. This will help me not only familiarize myself with Git, but also train me into the mindset of a software engineer and become more comfortable with the development lifecycle

**Learn how to effectively use a Javascript framework**

As I mentioned, I have started to dip my toes into more Javascript frameworks, I want to expand my knowledge of these technologies, so I can become more versatile and adaptable in the industry as I search for a job. As I have already started to learn how to utilize express.js, I feel like I will start there.

**Compete in a hackathon**

This last few months of my time as a student has left me rather frantic to pad my resume with all sorts of extracirricular activities. When I heard that a couple of my friends were deciding to attend a hackathon, I was really interested. Unfortunately, I was not in the right mindset to make anything, so I just went to introduce myself to the environment of a hackathon. However, I feel like if I had done the hackathon, I would have been doing it for the wrong reasons. I was more focused on filling out my rather lackluster resume, and I feel like this would not have been to my advantage. A hackathon should be about broadening ones own experiences with a certain technology, challenging yourself to be pushed to the limit, and hopefully coming out on top. That's why I'd like to not only attend a hackathon at some point next year, but to also compete in it. How well I do in that hackathon is left to be determined.

## Personal Resolutions ##

**Continue my fitness regimen**

I've never been to proud of my body. I certainly let myself go over my high school career, and my health showed for it. My freshman year college was my rock bottom, where I was weighing in at 220 lbs (not the good kind of weight). I had decided enough was enough and have started to eat healthier and exercise more. I have been exercising semi-regularly for about 2 years now, and I do not plan on stopping that when I graduate. I have made very good progress over those years and I do not want to lose it. I plan on getting a gym membership wherever I start working, and to go at least three times a week.

**Apply to four new jobs a week**

I need money. Everyone needs money. Jobs give money. I need a job. Simple logic right? It all comes down to never giving up. I resolve to find at least four jobs a week to apply to, and do so. If I find more, great.


I believe these resolutions will help me grow as a person, and benefit me in the long run. I guess my last resolution is that I want to write at least one blog post a month, to provide updates on how I am doing on my resolutions.
